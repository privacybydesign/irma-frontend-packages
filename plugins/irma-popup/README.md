# IRMA popup

This plugin contains a popup for IRMA flows in the web browser. The popup is
based on the "legacy" popup of [`irmajs`](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmajs).
This plugin exists to ease the transition from `irmajs` to the new plugin
structure, by allowing issuers and verifiers to switch to the new
`irma-frontend-packages`, independent of switching to the new design of `irma-web`.

Please note that not all states are currently supported by this plugin, so the
user will not be notified of an unsupported browser and will not be able to
retry their flow from the interface. See the [`irma-popup` example](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma-frontend-packages/tree/master/examples/browser/irma-popup)
for an implementation.

## Usage

```javascript
const IrmaCore = require('irma-core');
const Popup    = require('irma-popup');

const irma = new IrmaCore(/* options */);
irma.use(Popup);
irma.start();
```

## Options

### language

You can set the interface language by setting the `language` option. Currently
supported values: `en` and `nl`. Default is `nl`.

### translations

If you have more specific translation requirements, or if your use-case is not
logging a user in, you can override any of the strings in the interface using
the `translations` option. It is good practice to be specific in these texts to
avoid unnecessary confusion for your users.

```javascript
const irma = new IrmaCore({
  translations: {
    Common: {
      Cancel: 'Never mind!'
    },
    Verify: {
      Title: 'Sign in with IRMA',
      Body: 'Please provide your attributes to sign in. Scan the QR code with your IRMA app.'
    }
  }
});
```

You can find the default values [in the translation files](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma-frontend-packages/tree/master/plugins/irma-popup/translations).

## Development of this plugin

In contrast to the other plugins, this plugin needs to be built using Webpack.
For development, this means that you will want to run this in a console for this
directory:

```bash
npm install
webpack --mode development --watch
```

...while you have the example (or your own project) running using its own
Webpack dev server in a second console. This way, changes to this plugin will
trigger a rebuild, which will in turn trigger a rebuild of the project depending
on this plugin.
