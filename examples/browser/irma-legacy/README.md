# Browser IRMA legacy example

This package is an example for how to use `irma-legacy` in the
web browser. See the source of `index.js` and `public/index.html` for how we use it.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo application will then run on the URL mentioned in the terminal output
(usually http://localhost:8080/).
