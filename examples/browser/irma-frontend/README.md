# Browser IRMA frontend example

This package is an example for how to use the `irma-frontend` wrapper in the
web browser. See the source of `index.html` for how we use the wrapper.

This example uses the `irma-frontend` module from this repository. `irma-frontend` requires
its own installation and building steps. If you build this module from source,
you therefore have to perform building steps first before 
you can start this example. Otherwise the included CSS might not look fully like
it was intended. For an explanation how to do this you can check the README
of `irma-frontend`.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo application will then run on the URL mentioned in the terminal output
(usually http://localhost:8080/).
