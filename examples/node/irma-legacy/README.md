# Nodejs IRMA console example

This package is an example for how to use the `irma-legacy` module in the
terminal with `nodejs`. See the source of `index.js` for how we use the plugin.

This example uses the `irma-legacy` module from this repository. `irma-legacy` requires
its own installation and building steps. These steps have to be executed first before 
you can start this example. For an explanation how to do this you can check the README
of `irma-legacy`.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
